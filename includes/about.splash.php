                    <p class="">My name is Uzoh Daberechi and Iâ€™m a Visual and Digital Product Designer, I'm passionate about improving the lives of others through design.</p>
                    <p class="">I'm a self taught designer and have learnt a lot of the processes, concepts and theories of UX/UI and product design through workshops, reading blogs and applying them to projects i have done. Having an experience in Front-end development coupled with UI/UX Design has given me valuable industry exposure to learning and working with both designers and engineers. I'm constantly learning new things everyday and I love meeting people who are motivated and not afraid of sharing their ideas with the world.</p>
                    <p class="">Currently, I work with <span class="color-2"> Gotahia</span> as the product designer and also as a part-time creative designer for <span class="color-2">Jiggle.ng</span>. I have interest in Web development, motion graphics, photography and animation. I am currently based in Abuja, Nigeria and i enjoy travelling too! </p>
